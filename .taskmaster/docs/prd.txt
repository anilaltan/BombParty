Product Requirements Document (PRD): "Word Bomb" (Project Codename)
Overview
Word Bomb is a browser-based, real-time, multiplayer elimination game where players take turns deriving a valid Turkish word containing a randomly assigned syllable (e.g., "KA"). If players fail to type a word before the timer runs out, the bomb they are holding explodes, and they lose a life.

Problem Solved:

The lack of setup-free, instantly accessible party games for friend groups.

The inadequacy of existing "io" games regarding Turkish character support (İ, Ş, Ğ, etc.) and Turkish vocabulary.

Target Audience:

Discord communities, streamers, and their viewers.

Students and individuals looking to improve their vocabulary.

"Casual" gamers looking for quick (5-10 minute) sessions.

Value Proposition:

A game engine optimized 100% for the Turkish language structure.

Fluid gameplay experience with low latency.

Instant playability via browser without any downloads.

Core Features
1. The Syllable Engine
What it does: Assigns a random syllable (2 or 3 letters) to the player each turn (e.g., "BA", "KIR", "ZEL").


Why it's important: Ensures game balance and prevents "impossible" rounds.

How it works: The system analyzes the Turkish dictionary. Instead of random letters, it selects syllables that appear in at least 50 (configurable) valid words in the dataset.

2. Real-Time Word Validation
What it does: Instantly checks the word typed by the player.


Why it's important: Server response must be in milliseconds for gameplay flow.

How it works:

Does the input contain the syllable? (Regex check).

Is the word in the dictionary? (Hash map / Set lookup).

Has the word been used this round? (Used Words Array check).

3. Bomb & Timer Mechanics
What it does: A visual bomb countdown. As time decreases, the ticking sound and animation speed increase.


Why it's important: The core element that creates tension and excitement.

How it works: A server-side timer runs the countdown. Upon a successful word submission, the timer resets, and the bomb passes to the next player. If time runs out, the player loses a life.

4. Lobby & Room Management
What it does: Allows users to create private rooms or join public ones.


Why it's important: Necessary for social interaction and isolating friend groups.

How it works: Uses Socket.io "Rooms" feature to isolate game states.

User Experience
User Personas:


Fast Player Ali: Wants to hit "Play" immediately on the bus or during a break to play with random people without signing up.


Streamer Pelin: Wants to create a private room and share the link to play with her Twitch chat.

Key User Flows:

Entry: Enter Site -> Type Username -> Select Avatar (Optional).

Lobby: "Create Room" or "Join" -> Waiting Room -> Mark "Ready".

Game: Game Starts -> Your Turn -> See Syllable -> Type Word -> Enter -> Validate/Reject.


Result: Lives Depleted -> Switch to Spectator Mode -> End Game Scoreboard.

UI/UX Considerations:

Minimalism: Only essential info (Syllable, Input Field, Remaining Players, Bomb) should be on screen.

Feedback: Screen shake or red flash for invalid words; green flash and "ding" sound for valid ones.


Mobile Compatibility: Critical that the virtual keyboard does not obscure the game area.

Technical Architecture
System Components:

Backend: Node.js (Game logic and orchestration).

WebSocket: Socket.io (Real-time bidirectional communication).

Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS (SPA - Single Page Application).

Dictionary Service: JSON-based, RAM-loaded optimized TDK dataset.

Data Models (Simplified):

Room: { id, players[], status (waiting/playing), currentSyllable, usedWords[] }

Player: { socketId, nickname, lives, isTurn, score }

Infrastructure:

Node.js server running in Docker containers.

Nginx (Reverse Proxy and SSL termination).

Optional: Redis (For holding room states if scaling is needed).

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: The Core (Skeleton)
Basic Node.js + Socket.io setup.

Dictionary database integration and validation API.

Basic "Echo" test: Client sends word -> Server validates -> Returns response.

Room logic: Ensuring two users in different browsers can see each other.

Goal: Two people can take turns typing text, even with a crude UI.

Phase 2: The Game Loop (MVP)
Turn management implementation.

Timer (Bomb) logic.

Health system and player elimination.

Random syllable generation algorithm.

Basic UI (Input field and syllable display).

Goal: A playable, winnable/losable game loop.

Phase 3: UX & Polish
Animations (Bomb explosion, screen shake).

Sound effects (Tick-tock, explosion, correct word).

Mobile compatibility adjustments.

Username and avatar selection.

In-game chat.

Goal: A "fun" feeling, releasable version.

Logical Dependency Chain
Foundation: The game engine cannot be written without cleaning and verifying the Turkish word list. The dataset must be prepared first.

Connectivity: The game loop cannot be established without Socket connection and room management. Players must first be able to meet in the same "context".

Core Logic: Before visual development, backend rules like whose turn it is, if time is up, and if the word is correct must work perfectly. The frontend should just be a mirror reflecting these rules.


Feedback: Once the logic is solid, visual/audio feedback (UX) should be added.

Risks and Mitigations
Risk 1: Impossible Syllables.

Issue: System giving a syllable (e.g., "ĞP") with no valid Turkish words.

Mitigation: Pre-computation of the syllable pool to ensure every syllable has at least 50 valid dictionary matches.

Risk 2: Network Latency (Lag).

Issue: Player sends word right before time runs out, but latency causes an unfair explosion.

Mitigation: Implementing a server-side grace period (e.g., 200ms).

Risk 3: Abuse and Profanity.

Issue: Use of profanity in usernames or free text input.

Mitigation: Comprehensive "Bad Word Filter" (Blacklist) integration for both nicknames and in-game chat.
